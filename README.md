   Hello, I am Evan. You may know me as my username, Mevzach. I am a high-school student hailing from the United States.
   Ever since I was little, I've always been into computers and technology from a very young age, breaking computers and tinkering in areas I wasn't supposed to.
   I am an aspiring programmer interested in Python, C, and Assembly langauge. I am fairly new, and I am open to criticism, comments, and any other helpful points.
   I am experienced with using MacOS, Linux (Arch, Debian, Mint, and others), and Windows. I am not the greatest team player, but I hope to improve myself in weak areas as I continue.
   In my free time, I usually like to study computers, work on projects, play Chess and other games, occasionally help with kids in need and other community service.
   Thank you for reading this. My public contact information is below.
