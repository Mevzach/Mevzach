   Hello, my name's Evan. You might know me as my username, Mevzach. I am a high-school student from from the United States.
   I've always been into computers and technology from a very young age, always having a passion for tinkering and software.
   I am an aspiring programmer interested in Python, C, and Assembly langauge. I am fairly new, and I am open to criticism, comments, and any other helpful points.
   I am experienced with using MacOS, Linux (Arch, Debian, Mint, and others), Windows, FreeBSD, and Python. I am not the greatest team player, but I hope to improve myself in weak areas as I continue.
   In my free time, I usually like to study computers, work on projects, play Chess and other games, occasionally help with kids in need and other community service.
   Thank you for reading this. My public contact information is below.
